# Sub-Agent Framework for MCP Outreach Automation

- Achieve <1% error rate
- Handle 100+ concurrent requests
- Improve OAuth token management

SPECIFIC ISSUES:
- Occasional 401 errors during token refresh
- Template linking sometimes fails
- Bulk operations need optimization
- Rate limiting strategy needs refinement

Please analyze the current integration and provide optimization recommendations with specific implementation strategies."
```

### Example 4: Workflow Automation Design

## BEST PRACTICES FOR SUB-AGENT USAGE

### 1. Context Preparation
- **Always include current project context** from `CONTEXT.md`
- **Specify the domain challenge** clearly and completely
- **Include relevant technical constraints** and requirements
- **Define success criteria** and performance targets

### 2. Proper Activation
- **Use specific sub-agent activation** with clear role definition
- **Provide relevant background information** for context
- **Ask for specific deliverables** (strategy, plan, recommendations)
- **Set boundaries** on what analysis is needed

### 3. Result Integration
- **Read sub-agent outputs thoroughly** before implementation
- **Combine insights from multiple specialists** when needed
- **Use parent agent for all actual implementation** work
- **Update project context** with key strategic decisions

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Validate sub-agent recommendations** against project requirements
- **Cross-reference specialist advice** for consistency
- **Test proposed strategies** before full implementation
- **Monitor results** and iterate based on performance

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Project Context File
**Location**: `/Users/raphaelberrebi/mcp-outreach-server/CONTEXT.md`
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for project state and decisions
**Updates**: After each major sub-agent consultation and implementation

### Sub-Agent Output Storage
**Location**: `/Users/raphaelberrebi/mcp-outreach-server/.cloudcode/agents/`
**Contents**: Specialist knowledge bases and consultation templates
**Usage**: Reference for consistent sub-agent activation and context

**REMEMBER**: Sub-agents are your specialized research and strategy team. The parent agent (you) remains the implementer who brings all the strategic insights together into working code.
