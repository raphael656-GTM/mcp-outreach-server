```

#### 4. Problem Documentation
```markdown
## Document Issues and Resolutions
When encountering problems:
- Classify issue type (Technical/Integration/Performance/Business)
- Assess impact level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Document reproduction steps and error details
- Track resolution approaches and outcomes
```
